## Worldwide Crop Yield Data Visualization Competition 
(Data viz competition with two given data sets)

It is my first time joining the Data visualization competition held by Nashville Software School. It was fun and challenging.

I have used Tableau to create an interactive dashboard that allows you to choose a crop of your choice of interest and check out the crop yield among different countries in one glimpse. Please check it out. :)

Challenges and rewards: I started with Jupyter notebook using Python codes, creating interactive plots to connect to Bokeh Server.Further investigations are needed to sync the bokeh codes and my python codes. Given the time limit with the competition, I used Tableau to create the dashboard. I created a filter that needs to remove unwanted items including,

-complete calculation fields on measures and also used aggregation for calculation

-they will then show up under measure names

-convert measurements to dimensions, so only certain items show in filters of measure names

-hide unwanted fields on measure names to clean up the filters
